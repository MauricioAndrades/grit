GRIT - A tool for the integrative analysis of RNA-seq type assays. 

Build Dependencies:
  c compiler
  python headers
  cython

Runtime Dependencies:
  scipy 
  networkx 
  pysam

In a debian based system, running 

(sudo) apt-get install gcc python-dev cython python-scipy python-networkx
and then 
(sudo) easy_install pysam

should install all of the dependencies. 

INSTALLATION:

-Method 1: easy_install

Run: (sudo) easy_install GRIT-1.1.0.tar.gz

This should install the dependencies, the grit python module, and the grit 
script (run_grit.py). However, installing them through your distributions 
package manager is preferred whenever possible.

-Method 2: setup.py

1) unzip the package (tar -zxvf GRIT-VERSION.tar.gz)
2) move into the unzipped directory (cd GRIT-VERSION/)
3) run the setup script ((sudo) python setup.py install)

-Method 3: packages

Making debian, ubuntu, and redhat packages is on my TODO, but I haven't. 
If these would be useful, please feel free to send me an email and I'll
move it up the priority list.

RUNNING GRIT:

See README for a more detailed description. In addition, grit-bio.org has
a tutorial with a sample control files and data.
