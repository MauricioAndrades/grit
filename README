Annotation files:

1) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428.gtf.gz:
Contains all transcripts in gtf format. Coding regions are 
represented by the CDS element type. Exon and CDS lines with
the same transcript_id field correspond to the same transcript. 
So, to find all of the exons associated with mgn000001.a, run

grep mgn000001.a Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428.gtf 

at a unix shell. The transcript and gene naming conventions are 
described at the bottom of the README.

2) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428.gene.gtf.gz:
Contains gene bounds in GFF2 format. This information can be
extracted directly from the transcripts file. 

3) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428.trancript_bnds.gff.gz
Contains transcript bounds in GFF2 format. This information can be
extracted directly from the transcripts file.

4) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428.tss.gtf.gz:
Transcription start sites in GFF2. Locations included in this list
were either verified experimentally with CAGE signal or a full
length cDNA. 

5) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428.tes.gtf:
Transcription end sites in GFF2. Locations included in this list
were discovered from RNAseq data or a poly(a) read spanning cDNAs.

6) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428_jn.gff.gz:
Contains discovered intron regions in GFF2. The start and stop fields 
indicate the 1 based, inclusive, start and stop coordinates for each 
intron. The initial set of junctions were produced from the merged set
of tophat mapped RNAseq data. Potential junctions reads were 
then filtered according to the following rules:

a) Canonical  Junctions
Information score >= 2.0 in 2 distinct samples
b) Non-Canonical Junctions
Information score >= 2.5 in 2 distinct samples
c) Canonical Junctions Wrong Strand
Same as non-canonical and needed to have greater than 1% of the 
frequency of the corresponding canonical junction.

Finally, junctions that merged two genes were filtered
for uniqueness. 

The information score calculation  is described in "The developmental 
transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster" ( Graveley et. al. )

Expression Scores:

1) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428_gene_expression.csv:
Contains the total number of bases that overlaps at least one exon in 
the gene in the left most column. Each column corresponds to a single 
sample type, which is listed in the first row.

2) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428_exon_expression.csv:
Contains the total number of bases that overlaps the exon given by the 
region string in the left most column. The region strings take the form
"chromosome:strand:start_1_based_inclusive-stop_1_based_inclusive". Each 
additional column corresponds to a sample type, given in the first row.
If multiple exons overlap the same region, we distribute reads between 
them to maximize the read uniformity within an exon. The method is 
detailed in GRIT in estimate_exon_expression.py. 

3) Celniker_Drosophila_Annotation_20120616_1428_jn_expression.csv:
Contains the total number of junction reads that span the intron described by
the region string in the left most column. The region string format is
Chromosome:strand:start_1_based_inclusive-stop_1_based_inclusive. Each 
additional column corresponds with a sample type listed in the first row.

Naming Convention:

Transcripts names were chosen in an attempt to preserve the Flybase naming 
scheme whenever possible. We used the following procedure:

1) Matching Transcripts
    Must share the same introns as at least one flybase transcript. 
    - Use the flybase transcript and gene names
    - If there are multiple transcripts that match the flybase
      transcript, then give following transcripts FBNAME.a, 
      FBNAME.b, etc.

2) Overlapping Transcripts
    Must share a jn boundary or overlap a flybase gene
    - Use FBGENE_NAME for the gene name, and FBGENE_NAME.a, 
      FBGENE_NAME.b, etc. for the transcript names.

3) Novel Transcripts
    - name genes mgnXXXXX, and transcripts mgnXXXXX.a, mgnXXXXX.b, etc.
      where XXXXX is a five digit number.
